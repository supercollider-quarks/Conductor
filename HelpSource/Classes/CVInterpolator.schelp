DESCRIPTION::
CVInterpolator is a LINK::CLasses/CVPreset:: that enables interpolation between saved presets.

INSTANCEMETHODS::

METHOD:: interpItems
NOTE::Changing interpolation targets and degree of interpolation is all done by changing the values of targetCV and interpolationCV.::
ARGUMENT:: argCVs
STRONG::argCVs:: is a subset of STRONG::interpItems::

SUBSECTION:: Instance Variables

METHOD:: interpIndices
indices of items to be interpolated (used to look up presets)

METHOD:: interpItems
items to be interpolated

METHOD:: base
settings of the interpItems when a new target was selected

METHOD:: target
settings of items towards which interpolation converges

METHOD:: targetCV
CV used to choose the target of interpolation

METHOD:: interpCV
CV used to control the degree of interpolation, ranges from 0 to 1
